# ITI - Docker Lab Twoüêã
## Task 1: Run a container using nginx image, and mount a directory from your host into the Docker container.
example: /home/samy/nginx:/home/nginx (bind mount)

### Steps
#### 1. Create Bind Mount Directory
```bash
mkdir nginx_bindMount
cd nginx_bindMount
pwd
```

#### 2. Run a container using nginx image
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_bindMount -v /root/nginx_bindMount:/user/share/nginx/html nginx
docker exec -it nginx_bindMount bash
```

#### 3. Echo any content to show when curl ip-address
```bash
cd /user/share/nginx/html
echo "Hello from Bind Mount Nginx" > index.html
exit
docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}' nginx_bindMount    ->172.17.0.2
curl 172.17.0.2
```

## Task 2: Create 2 docker network (net-1 & net-2)

### Steps
#### 1. Create 2 docker network (net-1 & net-2)
```bash
docker network create network_1
docker network create network_2
```

#### 2. Run 2 new containers using nginx:alpine image, and attach the net-1 to them.
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_net1 --net network_1 nginx:alpine
docker run -d --name nginx_net2 --network network_1 nginx:alpine
```

#### 3. Run another 1 new containers using nginx:alpine image, and attach the net-2 to them.
```bash
docker run -d --name nginx_net3 --net network_2 nginx:alpine
```

#### 4. Inspect the 3 containers to know their IPs and write them aside.
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.network_1.IPAddress}}' nginx_net1
172.18.0.2

docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.network_1.IPAddress}}' nginx_net2
172.18.0.3

docker inspect -f '{{.NetworkSettings.Networks.network_2.IPAddress}}' nginx_net3
172.20.0.2
can use : docker inspect nginx_net1 | grep IPAddress
```

#### 5. Enter a container in the net-1 network and try to ping a container in the net-2 network (What do you notice?)
```bash
docker exec -it nginx_net1 sh 
Use ping or curl
ping 172.20.0.2
ping fails, because the two containers exist in different networks so we can see any response in terminal.
```

#### 6. Enter a container in the net-1 network and try to ping the other container in the same network (What do you notice?)
```bash
docker exec -it nginx_net1 sh 
curl 172.18.0.2
ping 172.18.0.3
ping successful and return response, because the two containers exist in the same network.
```

## Task 3: Explain the difference between Docker volumes and Bind Mount.
### Docker Volumes
‚óè Docker volumes are managed by Docker and stored in a part of the host filesystem that is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes on Linux).
‚óè Volumes are designed to be persistent, meaning the data in a volume will persist even after the container is removed.
‚óè Volumes can be shared between multiple containers, allowing for data sharing and collaboration.
‚óè Volumes can be backed up, restored, and migrated more easily than bind mounts.
‚óè Volumes are managed by Docker, which means you don't have to worry about the specific details of where the data is stored on the host filesystem

### Docker Bind Mounts
‚óè Bind mounts are a way to mount a file or directory from the host machine into a container.
‚óè The location of the mount on the host machine is specified by the user when the container is started.
‚óè Bind mounts are tightly coupled to the host machine's filesystem, which can make it harder to move containers between hosts.
‚óè Bind mounts are useful when you need to access specific files or directories on the host machine from within the container.
‚óè Bind mounts are more flexible than volumes, as you can mount any directory from the host machine into the container
